Description

The Telegram Notification Tool allows users to send a notification message to a specific Telegram chat using the Telegram Bot API. This tool can be used as a standalone geoprocessing tool or integrated into ModelBuilder workflows. It is particularly useful for notifying task completion or providing updates during long-running geoprocessing workflows.
                
Usage
The tool is designed to send a message to a Telegram user, group, or channel. Users need to provide the following:
  1. A valid Telegram Bot API Token (created via BotFather).
  2. The Chat ID of the Telegram recipient (user, group, or channel).
  3. A custom message to be sent as a notification.
                
This tool can be used in any geoprocessing workflow or as a standalone tool in ArcGIS Pro.
